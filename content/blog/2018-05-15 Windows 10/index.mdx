I love changes, especially good changes. But Windows OS update is not one of those. I have been using Windows 7 for my home workstation nearly a decade. But I decided to update Windows 10 last week. The biggest reason is the new Premiere is dropping support Dolby AC3 (which means there is no easy way to edit my video shot on my sony cam).

Here are my Day 01 observations during the course of my setup:

1. I upgraded with my Windows 7 OEM key (although Microsoft claimed a paid upgrade is required since early 2018) I installed Windows 10 from a clean USB thumb drive. 

2. Removing items from Windows Explorer sidebar is extremely annoying. In my case, I want to get rid of OneDrive and 3D Objects. You will need to edit Registry in two different paths

3. There's a Microsoft Store now but it is nothing like Mac App Store. You can still download the app from Store (Store App) or Web (Desktop App). Some of them are exactly the same, some are not. You will have to figure it out by yourself. The only app I have downloaded so far is Netflix app, as it supports 1080p and 4K HDR. You can only stream 720p video from Chrome currently.
