> Water falls.
> Water falls from bright air.
> It falls like hair, falling across a young girl’s shoulders.
> Water falls making pools in the asphalt, dirty mirrors with clouds and buildings inside.
> It falls on the roof of my house.
> It falls on my mother and on my hair.
> Most people call it rain.
