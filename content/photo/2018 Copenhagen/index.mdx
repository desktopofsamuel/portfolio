#### Iceland 2017

<ZoomImage src={camera} caption="Hello World" />

Final stop of the 7-day road trip, Reykjavik is a small but beautiful city. I took some snapshots of the inspiring street arts and cafes. It was very exciting to explore this vibrant city by foot.

I was told that you should visit Iceland at least twice, once in summer and once in winter. The country completely transform when season changes.
