Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are two mostly different city in the same country. Earliest historical records indicate Jerusalem first built temple was 3000 years ago, while Tel Aviv was only built less than 100 years. Garden City Movement, an urban planning movement upholds the idea of self-sustaining communities and greenbelt heavily influenced the city's planning. Long shoreline with beaches, long avenue covered with trees has made the city incredibly bike/walking friendly.
