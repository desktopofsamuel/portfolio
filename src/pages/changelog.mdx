## Mar 8,2020

My previous focus on the Photo section is to make Gatsby possible to serve as a photo portfolio. Now that it is completed (with some kind of manual work), I'm working on the aesthetic side. I have revamped the Photo Index Page and added a Photo grid section on Home page. The feature photo set seems still need some work on it as the style is incoherent. Loading speed of the home page is affected due to the photos added in the section, still working on a solution to it.
